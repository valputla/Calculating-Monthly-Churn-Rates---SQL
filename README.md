# Calculating-Monthly-Churn-Rates-SQL
Analyzing data with SQL to calculate churn rate between 2 segments.

This project is part of the "Analyze Data with SQL" course from Codecademy.com. Using the hypothetical company "Codeflix," management is asking how well the company is doing with customer retention in the first quarter of the year.

Goal:
- Determine monthly subscription churn rates between two segements of users.

The dataset provided to you contains one SQL table, subscriptions. 
Within the table, there are 4 columns:
- id - the subscription id
- subscription_start - the start date of the subscription
- subscription_end - the end date of the subscription
- segment - this identifies which segment the subscription owner belongs to

Codeflix requires a minimum subscription length of 31 days, so a user can never start and end their subscription in the same month.

Portions of this project description are taken from the project explanantion on Codecademy.com.
